## Overview

The navigation menu provides the main structure for your documentation website, appearing as a list of organized links. Every page you want visible needs to be explicitly added to your navigation configuration in `mint.json`.

## Basic Navigation Structure

Your navigation structure lives in the `mint.json` file. The basic structure uses groups to organize your content into logical sections.

### Simple Navigation Groups

The most basic navigation setup uses a group with a list of pages:

```json
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
]
```

### Nested Navigation Groups

For more complex documentation, you can nest groups within groups:

```json
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
]
```

<Note>
You don't need to include the `.mdx` extension when referencing pages in your navigation structure.

## Working with Folders

Organizing content in folders helps maintain a clean documentation structure. Here's how to set up and reference content in folders:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your folder structure">
    Create a new folder in your documentation root with a descriptive name like `your-folder`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your content file">
    Place your MDX file inside the folder - for example `your-page.mdx`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update navigation">
    Reference the file in your navigation using the folder path:
    ```json
    "navigation": [
        {
            "group": "Group Name",
            "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
        }
    ]
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Folder Naming Restrictions

<Warning>
The name `api` is reserved for internal use at the root level. If you need an API section, use an alternate name like:

- `api-reference`
- `api-docs` 
- `apis`

Or nest your `api` folder inside another folder.
</Warning>

## Advanced Navigation Features

### Hidden Pages

You can create pages that don't appear in the navigation but remain accessible in two ways:

1. Through the search bar
2. By direct URL access

To create a hidden page:

1. Create your MDX file as normal
2. Simply omit it from the navigation configuration in `mint.json`

This is useful for:
- Draft content
- Supporting documentation
- Specialized pages that should only be accessed via direct links

### Page Organization Tips

1. Group related content together
2. Use clear, descriptive group names
3. Keep your navigation hierarchy shallow (2-3 levels deep)
4. Place frequently accessed content at higher levels
5. Consider using hidden pages for supplementary content
