## Understanding Snippets

Snippets are reusable pieces of documentation that help maintain consistency across your content. When you update a snippet, the changes automatically reflect everywhere the snippet is used.

### Directory Requirements

<Note>
  All snippet files must be created in the `snippets` directory. These files won't be rendered as standalone pages, but can be imported into other documentation pages.
</Note>

## Types of Snippets

### Basic Content Snippets

The simplest form of snippets contains static content that you want to reuse across multiple pages.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the snippet file">
    Create a new MDX file in your snippets directory with your reusable content:

    ```mdx snippets/welcome-message.mdx
    Welcome to our documentation! We're excited to help you get started with our platform.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import and use the snippet">
    Import the snippet into any documentation page where you want to use it:

    ```mdx
    import WelcomeMessage from '/snippets/welcome-message.mdx';

    # Getting Started
    <WelcomeMessage />
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Dynamic Content Snippets

You can make your snippets more flexible by adding variables that can be passed as props.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a dynamic snippet">
    Create a snippet file that accepts and uses props:

    ```mdx snippets/greeting.mdx
    Hello {name}! Welcome to our {product} documentation.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the dynamic snippet">
    Import and use the snippet with custom values:

    ```mdx
    import Greeting from '/snippets/greeting.mdx';

    <Greeting name="Developer" product="API" />
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Reusable Variables

Use exported variables to maintain consistent values across your documentation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your variables">
    Create a snippet file with exported constants:

    ```mdx snippets/constants.mdx
    export const version = 'v2.0.0';
    export const apiEndpoint = 'https://api.example.com';
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the variables">
    Import and use the variables in your content:

    ```mdx
    import { version, apiEndpoint } from '/snippets/constants.mdx';

    The current release is {version}. 
    All requests should be sent to {apiEndpoint}.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Component Snippets

For more complex reusable content, you can create component snippets.

<Warning>
  When creating component snippets, use HTML syntax instead of MDX in the component body, as MDX doesn't compile within arrow functions.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a component snippet">
    Create a reusable component with props:

    ```mdx snippets/alert-box.mdx
    export const AlertBox = ({ title, severity }) => (
      <div className={`alert alert-${severity}`}>
        <h4>{title}</h4>
        <slot />
      </div>
    );
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the component">
    Import and use the component with your desired props:

    ```mdx
    import { AlertBox } from '/snippets/alert-box.mdx';

    <AlertBox title="Important Update" severity="warning">
      This feature will be deprecated in the next release.
    </AlertBox>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

1. **Keep snippets focused**: Each snippet should serve a single, clear purpose
2. **Use meaningful names**: Name your snippet files descriptively
3. **Document props**: If your snippet accepts props, document them in the snippet file
4. **Version control**: Update all instances when making changes to shared snippets
