## Getting Started with Your Documentation

Welcome to the quickstart guide! This guide will walk you through setting up, previewing, and deploying your documentation. Follow these steps to get your documentation site up and running quickly.

## Local Development Setup

Before you can start making changes to your documentation, you'll need to set up your local development environment. This section will guide you through the necessary steps.

### Setting Up Your Repository

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Repository">
    During the onboarding process, we created a GitHub repository containing your documentation content. You can find this repository on our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone Repository">
    Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Follow GitHub's [cloning instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) in your terminal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Installing and Running Preview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Mintlify CLI">
    Install our command line interface to preview documentation changes locally:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mintlify
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Preview Server">
    Navigate to your documentation's root directory (where `mint.json` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment Process

Learn how to get your documentation changes live on your site. We've simplified the process to make deployment as seamless as possible.

### Automated Deployment Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install GitHub App">
    Our GitHub app handles automatic deployments of your documentation. To set it up:
    1. Visit your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
    2. Look for the GitHub app installation link
    3. Follow the installation prompts
    
    You'll know it's working when you see a check mark next to your repository's commit hash.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Changes">
    To deploy your documentation updates:
    1. Commit your changes locally
    2. [Push your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push) to GitHub
    3. The app will automatically deploy your changes
    
    If automatic deployment doesn't trigger, you can manually deploy through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Step>
</Steps>
